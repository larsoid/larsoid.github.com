Piet Hein wrote this "grook" that has been an inspiration to me when 
feeling that things are not happening fast enough:

<h3>T. T. T.</h3>
<br>
Put up in a place
where it's easy to see
the cryptic admonishment
<b>T. T. T.</b>
<br>
When you feel how depressingly
slowly you climb,
it's well to remember that
<b>Things Take Time!</b>
